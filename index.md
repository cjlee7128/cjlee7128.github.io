  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a Ph.D. student at the University at Buffalo, conducting research under the supervision of <strong><a href="https://www.xlab-ub.com/">Prof. Jinjun Xiong</a></strong>. My work focuses on developing innovative Machine Learning (ML) platforms, including <strong>MLModelScope</strong> and <strong>MLHarness</strong>, aimed at providing scalable solutions for real-world applications, such as AI-driven educational technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
    My goal is to leverage ML models and Deep Learning frameworks to address complex problems efficiently, focusing on making these technologies more accessible for broader audiences.
